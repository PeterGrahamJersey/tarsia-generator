# Tarsia Puzzle Generator

Allows you to create and print a tarsia style puzzle.
There is a more comprehensive editor available online, but it doesn't seem to support mac.

Huge thanks to [Dale Blackburn](https://github.com/dakebl) for his amazing advice in this project ðŸ’›

ToDo:
- Behind the scenes
    - Use of 'Map' - consider for print triangles and questions
    - Correct GridIcon alignment, not centered
    - CSS tidying
- Functionality
    - Add og:image tag
    - Signpost / initial test prompting people to enter a question / answer
    - Accessibility check + improvement
    - Randomised order for print out
    - Distractors (that end up on the outside)
